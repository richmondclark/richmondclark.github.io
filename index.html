<h1>Richmond Clark</h1>

<h2>Solicitors & Notaries</h2>

<p>We are here to meet you and your family's legal needs.</p>

<p>Welcome to Richmond Clark. We are a newly established legal practice based at Anniesland Cross in Glasgow.</p>

<p>We seek to offer a high-standard, cost-effective and straight-forward service for you and your family's private and personal legal requirements.</p>

<h3>Our key areas of work are:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Wills</li>
    <li>Executries</li>
    <li>Powers of Attorney</li>
    <li>Guardianship</li>
    <li>Conveyancing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wills</h3>
<p>Where there's a Will there's a way - of making sure that your own wishes are carried out. If you die without having prepared a Will, individuals who were not intended to benefit from your estate may do so. There will also be further procedure and costs involved. It is also important to remember that members of your immediate family will always have a claim on your estate.</p>

<h3>Executries</h3>
<p>When a relative has died, we can assist in the winding-up of an estate. Our services range from establishing valuations, calculating tax, applying for Confirmation, in gathering the estate and distributing the sums involved to the beneficiaries.</p>

<h3>Powers of Attorney</h3>
<p>A Power of Attorney allows you to appoint another person to make decisions in relation to your welfare or financial and property matters, or a combination of these. Powers of Attorney are now used very frequently to allow one person or more to manage another person's affairs.</p>

<h3>Guardianships</h3>
<p>A Guardianship Order is a court appointment which again allows one person or more to make decisions in relation to your welfare or financial and property matters, or a combination of these. The difference between a Power of Attorney and a Guardianship Order is that for a Power of Attorney you must have capacity (the necessary understanding) whereas for a Guardianship Order the person who is to be subject to the order musth ave lost capacity.</p>

<h3>Conveyancing</h3>
<p>We are able to assist you in the buying or selling of your home. We are also able to help with a remortgage or with a discharge of standard securities.</p>

<p>Introductory offer: single Will £75 (inc. VAT); couples Will £100 (inc. VAT)
